# Radio Toggle and Push-to-talk

This mod adds a keybinding to toggle whether your voice chat should transfer over radio such that you can listen to radio messages whilst only talking locally. It also adds a keybind to transmit over radio only whilst holding that specific push-to-transmit button.

If you require the Radio-Toggle mode to be on by default, try out this extension:
